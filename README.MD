# DECENTRALIZED & INCENTIVIZED Q&A FORUM USING BLOCKCHAIN

This project is developed to facilitate students of UMass Boston to post the questions they have regarding their course in a public forum. These questions can be viewed by other students and professors. This forum is totally incentivized. Every question posted carries a value and that value can be earned by anyone who posts the best answer
